    <h2><i><u>Childhood Years</u></i></h2>
    <blockquote><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During my childhood years, as I could still remember, I live a normal life.<sup>1</sup> Every summer, my family and relatives from my mother side, we would go to Batangas where my aunt has a house and spent like 2 to 3 weeks there and enjoy our time.<sup>2</sup> Although we are not rich, I’m thankful for my parents for still sending me and sister in a good private school where we learn a lot of good things and met great teachers which helped me to shape my future self.<sup>3</sup> Ever since I was kid, I already love joining different extracurricular activities.<sup>4</sup> I joined a dance group where we dance every Sunday at church, that’s where I also discovered that my talent is dancing.<sup>5</sup> I also learned how to play the guitar and drums during my elementary days.<sup>6</sup> And another prominent milestone is that I joined a taekwondo team during my childhood days.<sup>7</sup> Basically, my childhood years is the moment I discover myself.<sup>8</sup> Tried a lot of things which opened my mind that “oh! This is something I’m very passionate about.”<sup>9</sup> I am also glad that I spent my childhood fruitfully.<sup>10</sup> I used to play outside of our house with some neighbors the same age as me.<sup>11</sup> Instead of pressuring myself to just study and have good grades.<sup>12</sup> Although I didn’t neglect my studies, I just balanced it out and have fun at the same time.<sup>13</sup> This is where I also discovered my fears.<sup>14</sup> I’m terrified of heights and I still am.<sup>15</sup> I also don’t know how to swim.<sup>16</sup> I would be mad if they pressured me to swim because when I was 4-6 years old, I almost drowned 3 times.<sup>17</sup> Since then, whenever I’m in a pool or beach, I can’t go as deep as 5 feet.<sup>18</sup> I would start to shake and would ask for help from my family or friends.<sup>19</sup> Those are the moments I remembered from my childhood years that are still vivid in my mind.<sup>20</sup></p></blockquote>

    <h2><i><u>Teenage Years</u></i></h2>
    <blockquote><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When junior high school started, it's also the start of my teenage years where a lot of things changed.<sup>1</sup> I transferred to a bigger school compared from the school I last went to, and it's a really big step for me as someone who don't know how to socialize.<sup>2</sup> The reason I also transferred to <abbr title="Sen. Renato Companero Cayetano Memorial Science and Technology High School">SRCCMSTHS</abbr> was because my sister, who is two years ahead of me, was already studying there.<sup>3</sup> I met some of friends and went there to teach them a dance, and from that moment I really want to study there.<sup>4</sup> I met new people although it's quite hard at first since I'm hesitant.<sup>5</sup> I continued playing taekwondo in 7th grade since our school also has their own team, but I stopped before the school year ends because of some problems with the coach.<sup>6</sup> During those years, I also become more interested in dancing.<sup>7</sup> I joined a group in the school where they perform whenever there is an event for intermission number and the likes.<sup>8</sup> And when 9th grade happened, that year would probably one of the highlight of my high school life.<sup>9</sup> Because during 7th and 8th grade, there is nothing much moment in my life that I consider significant or memorable.<sup>10</sup> It's a normal kind of year for me during those times.<sup>11</sup> In 9th grade, I joined our school's Citizenship Advancement Training and trained for the rest of the school year.<sup>12</sup> I met new friends because of it, some who was never in the same class I've been to for the past 3 years.<sup>13</sup> I also experienced new things like going to places I've never been into as well.<sup>14</sup> Sometimes we would go to each other's house and spend some time there.<sup>15</sup> I also become close to some of my seniors (who were also our officers in <abbr title="Citizen Advancement Training">CAT</abbr>) and I learned a lot of things from them which I followed some of it while I'm still in the school.<sup>16</sup> There were hardships along the way of course, in studies, family, and in the organization, which is why I learned how to be tough and become distant at some point.<sup>17</sup> At the end of my 9th grade, we conducted a Turn-over Ceremony where our officers will pass unto us there position.<sup>18</sup> I was grateful during that time since I achieved my goal on becoming a Battalion Commander which was the highest rank that was given.<sup>19</sup> It was my dream from the start and it motivated me to do good and work hard not only in studies but also for myself.<sup>20</sup></p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Start of 10th grade, and the last year of my junior high school life, it became a little bit harder for me.<sup>1</sup> I'm struggling mentally, emotionally, and my studies become affected.<sup>2</sup> That's why I focused myself in <abbr title="Citizen Advancement Training">CAT</abbr> and trained new cadets since we were the officers during that time.<sup>3</sup> I lost some people and gain some.<sup>4</sup> It was definitely a challenging year in my life.<sup>5</sup> But I won't tell it here since it's personal and I just want to keep to myself.<sup>6</sup> During the last few months, it was bittersweet since moving up is approaching and some would stay in <abbr title="Sen. Renato Companero Cayetano Memorial Science and Technology High School">SRCCMSTHS</abbr> and some would transfer to another school for senior high school.<sup>7</sup> In my case, I transferred to a new school for senior high becasue we moved to Taytay and <abbr title="Sen. Renato Companero Cayetano Memorial Science and Technology High School">SRCCMSTHS</abbr> is in Taguig.<sup>8</sup> It was hard but I tried my best to adapt to the new environment, aside from the fact that I lost in touch with most of my junior high friends.<sup>9</sup> When senior high school started, I was very nervous since I'm new to the place and I don't really know everyone.<sup>10</sup> Luckily, I met 3 friends who would be with be to get through the senior high school life and would ease my concerns regarding living in a new environment that wasn't familiar to me.<sup>11</sup> Also, in senior high, I joined a dance group which is different from the ones I joined in during junior high.<sup>12</sup> It's more on the professional side and I experienced competing outside of school because of them.<sup>13</sup> Because of it, I improved my skills in dancing which I neglected for the past 2 years because I'm too busy with school and <abbr title="Citizen Advancement Training">CAT</abbr>.<sup>13</sup> During my last year in senior high, I don't really danced that much.<sup>14</sup> After first semester, I stopped and focused in studying and having time with my friends.<sup>15</sup> Since we're on our senior year, we also started applying for universities and preparing for entrance examinations.<sup>16</sup> I was happy during that year since I'm finally decided on what program I want to take in college, because ever since junior high, I was so undecided about it.<sup>17</sup> Throughout the last months, I just really enjoyed the time remaining before entering the college life.<sup>18</sup> It was only 2 years but I'm somehow glad it happened.<sup>19</sup> Because I'm glad I met Kim, Allison, and Alex who was able to understand me.<sup>20</sup></p></blockquote>
 
    <h2><i><u>College Years</u></i></h2>
    <blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the beginning of my college years, I was nervous since I'm close to adulthood.<sup>1</sup> For the university I want to go to, I decided to choose University of the East.<sup>2</sup> Mainly because when I researched what are the best schools for Information Technology, <abbr title="University of the East">UE</abbr> was included and also becasue I had a cousin who also graduated in it.<sup>3</sup> On my first day, I actually arrived really early.<sup>4</sup> It was my first time studying in Manila so I don't want to be late because I hate being late.<sup>5</sup> I was terrified because back in senior high I chose the track General Academic Strand since I am not yet decided on what program I want back in 11th grade.<sup>6</sup> Apparently, most of my blockmates that time, they all had a background about programming.<sup>7</sup> It made me nervous where at one point I was thinking of changing program but I just motivated myself that I'll be able to learn all of the things that are important eventually.<sup>8</sup> During the first year, it was hard because I'm adapting to the new environment and as well as managing my emotions since it was also stressful for me.<sup>9</sup> Another memorable moment for me would be meeting my friends right now.<sup>10</sup> It feels nice to have friends who would not only help you but would also listen to your worries and cheer for you.<sup>11</sup> Unfortunately, our first year in college was cut short because of the pandemic.<sup>12</sup> Last March 2020, the national government decided to implement a lockdown which resulted to an early academic break.<sup>13</sup> While the pandemic is still there, our second year would be through online classes since we can't gather a lot of people in one place to prevent the spread of virus.<sup>14</sup> Even though I know it would be for the best since we can't risk ourselves to be exposed, I was also sad that we wouldn't be able to have face-to-face classes.<sup>15</sup> We wouldn't be able to enjoy college physically together before we become busy in Thesis starting in third year.<sup>16</sup> Although there is sadness, we are also thankful that we could still enroll and continue our studies.<sup>17</sup> Hopefully the pandemic would end so we could have face-to-face classes again.<sup>18</sup> For now, we would enjoy what we could do while still having an online class.<sup>19</sup> I also hope we would be able to get through safely.<sup>20</sup></p></blockquote>
