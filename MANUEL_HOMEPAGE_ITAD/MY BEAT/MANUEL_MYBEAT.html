    	<p>R&B stands for rhythm and blues, it is a music that is rhythmic and has the soulful achings of blue. This type of music is actually my all time favorite. I could listen to it all day if I want to because I can feel the emotions, how musically good the songs are, and the way I could relate to it regardless of what emotion I have while listening. I enjoy those kind of things. I actually have a playlist containing just R&B music from my favorite singers. For this genre, there are a lot of notable artists like Frank Ocean, Usher, Mary J. Blige, Alicia Keys, and many more.
