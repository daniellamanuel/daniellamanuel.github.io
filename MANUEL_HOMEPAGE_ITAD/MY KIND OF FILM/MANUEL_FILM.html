            <br><br>
        The Good Place is one of my favorite TV shows because it is not just about comedy and whatnot, it actually teaches you a lot of lesson in real life. It opened my eyes on some issues especially to my personal life. Apart from the numerous lessons, the story if also fun and makes you want to watch more and become curious as to what will happen next. It has a good storyline, the dialogues are amazing, and the portrayal actors are perfect for their characters.</p>

        This show got me hooked up from the start. It is so entertaining and got me on my feet. As I watch every episode, I always want more because the actors had great chemistry and it is not just about action where they will catch an evil spirit. It also portrays about life and how we could still have fun or joke around even though there are problems. It also showcases amazing team work, friendship, and loving your family. The storyline is good and I hope they would be able to have season two.</p>

            <br><br>
        Brooklyn Nine-Nine have become my go-to-tv show because it's light and funny. Perfect for any day you just want to have a good laugh. The story every episode connects but still has its own twist and differs from other episode if you get what I mean. The characters are also amazing. Despite it being a comedy show, it still features social issues which is good in my opinion. The dialogues are perfect. The creators are really amazing. I'm just sad that it will only have eight seasons, but nevertheless, it is still an amazing show for me.</p>

            <br><br>
        A drama were I could rewatch it all over again and still enjoy. I love the friendship of the five main characters in this show. Despite having different preferences, personality, and schedule, they still find time supporting and hanging out with each other. I'm glad that it will have a second season because I want more and I know the story could still expand. It showcases the important roles of the people in the medical field. Also shows different types of coping mechanism and life story of different patients. I really love this show and would highly recommend it.</p>

As someone who was once part of a dance group, I know the feeling and could relate to the movie. I would also like to praise the dance routines they show. It's the highlight of every movie and each movie has this theme which is perfect.</p>

        <h3> The Half of It</h3>
        <video controls height="250px" width="350px" poster="" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;">
            <source src="VIDEO_FILM/Half of It.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video>
        <p>This is an American coming-of-age comedy-drama movie written and directed by Alice Wu. It was released in Netflix on May 1, 2020. The Half of It stars Leah Lewis, Alexxis Lemire, Daniel Diemer, and Chollin Chou. The movie is about a friendless straight A student Ellie Chu who was approached by an inarticulate football player, Paul Munsky to write a love letter to Aster Flores. At first, Ellie refuses, but accepts it in the end when she found out that their electricity would be cut off if they don't pay. The two connect over their shared interests in literature and art, though Aster believes she is communicating with Paul.
            <br><br>
        I rarely watch coming-of-age movies but this in particular caught my attention. Although the movie contains some cliche events, I still liked it since watching, I felt the sincerity in every moment. As someone part of the LGBTQ+ community, this is a light hearted film that I think everyone could watch and relate to in some ways. The actors are also good and the dialogues are amazing. I really like Alice Wu's films.</p>
